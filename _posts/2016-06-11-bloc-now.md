title: Bloc and Beyond
---

5 weeks left for me to finish Rails Web Development course and im honestly scared and happy at the same time. I have learn so much in the last new months but i feel like i still have a long way to go . Before starting the course I didnt know anything about Rails. Now, I know much of its syntax and convention among many other new things. After learning Ruby I have realized that many OOP languages have similar syntax . I've meddled a little with javascript and I understand it a lot clearer now that I put some time into Ruby, thought they do vary in some situations.


I had an expectations of Bloc when I began the course and it has exceeded them immensely. Even though there is still much to learn, I wouldnt of been at this point right now if it wasnt for Bloc. There is only one way to go now , and that is up. Now I got to put my ass into gear and prepare for the future.


Ps: As you can tell, im a horrible writer but I try :P .
