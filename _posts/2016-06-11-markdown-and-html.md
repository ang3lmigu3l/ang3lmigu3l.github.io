title: Biggest struggles
---

I have always struggled a bit with reading not gonna lie. Thought ive never been diagnosed with it I believe I might have some form of dyslexia. I sometime read numbers such as 123 as 321 in my head without even knowing. One thing I finding myself doing a lot is when I try to type "dog" i type "god" and even though I see ive incorrectly spelled it my brain still process it as "dog" . Strange I know.

This has affect me in my roading to becoming a web developer but im doing my best to not let it affect me. Reading documentation can be very stressful sometimes because I could read things 2-3 times and still get nothing out of it. For example when I was doing the Kele API Gem project I was at the second checkpoint, why ? I couldnt comprehend what it was asking me to do . I got a hold of my mentor and he was able to easily explain what I was suppose to do and it was something completely simple. I just wasn't sinking in. Simply put, you can say im a visual learner . Thought it is causing a few headaches, I am not allowing it to get in the way of me completing my assigments. Did I happen to say im at 150% completed right now? with 4 Projects completed? * brushes dirt of my shoulder *

Another way Im dealing with my disability to retain most of the information I have been given is by going back and reviewing my previously completed checkpoints. And let me tell you it helps. Example, I had been dealing with classes in Rails apps for months and I couldn't rap my head around `classes` that easily until i was able to go back and review it and also do some outside research. I am very proud of the progress Ive made in bloc and as a person too. Though there are struggles to come I know i can over come them if I put my mind to it.
